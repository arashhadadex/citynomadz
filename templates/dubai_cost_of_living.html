    <div class="city-description">
        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        <p>
            Rent in Dubai is significantly higher than in many other cities. A one-bedroom apartment in a central area can range from $1,500-$3,000 USD per month, while outside the center it might be $800-$1,500 USD.
        </p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>
            Dining out can be expensive, especially in upscale restaurants. A meal at a casual restaurant might cost $15-$30 USD. Groceries are also generally more expensive than in many other countries.
        </p>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>
            Public transportation (metro, buses) is efficient but can be more costly than in other cities. Taxis are readily available but add up quickly. Many residents opt for ride-sharing services or personal cars.
        </p>

        <h2>Entertainment and Leisure</h2>
        <p>
            Dubai offers a luxurious lifestyle with many high-end entertainment options, which can be very costly. However, there are also many free or low-cost activities available.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>
            Dubai is known for its high cost of living, particularly for accommodation and luxury goods. Careful budgeting is essential for those planning to live here.
