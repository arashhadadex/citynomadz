    <h1>🇦🇲 I Spent 72 Hours in Yerevan, Armenia – And It Changed My Life</h1>

    <p>You won't believe if I tell you this hidden European capital is filled with music, wine, and joy. It started with a flight I booked with one of my friends back in January 2025. I needed a break—and ended up finding a city that felt like home.</p>
    <p>In just 3 days, Yerevan showed me everything: glowing Christmas lights, ancient spiritual power, wild parties, rich wine, kind strangers, jazz cafés, and a panoramic skyline I still see when I close my eyes.</p>
    <p>If you love food, culture, photography, or want to feel alive again… this is the city guide you didn't know you needed.</p>

    <h2>Day 1 – The First Sip of the City: Wine, Views & Late-Night Walks</h2>
    <p>🛬 Landed in the Zvartnots Airport</p>
    <p>The moment I stepped off the plane, Yerevan greeted me with warmth and love. I checked into <strong>Holiday Inn Express Yerevan</strong>, a 4-star hotel stay just a short walk from Republic Square—clean rooms, a view of Mount Ararat, and a bar with live music? Yes, please.</p>

    <p><strong>Other luxury picks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ibis Yerevan Center</strong> – Walking distance to major attractions</li>
        <li><strong>Best Western Plus Congress</strong> – Spacious garden with a pool and loungers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🧳 <strong>Tip:</strong> Hotel prices in Yerevan are surprisingly affordable for the luxury you get.</p>

    <h3>🏛 Republic Square & Cascade Complex</h3>
    <p>After a quick nap, we walked through Republic Square—golden lights dancing off the cobblestones, Santa Claus, people smiling. You know that movie moment when time slows down? That was it.</p>
    <p>Next stop: <strong>Cascade Complex</strong>. Imagine a staircase of fountains, contemporary art, and 360-degree views of Yerevan—all under the stars.</p>

    <h3>🍷 Wine Like Nowhere Else</h3>
    <p>Dinner was at <strong>Lavash Restaurant</strong>—a cozy place with locals sipping wine and laughing. Armenian wine is tasty, earthy, and ancient.</p>
    <p><strong>Must-try wineries:</strong></p>

        <li>Karas Wines</li>
        <li>Voskevaz Areni</li>

    <h3>🍽️ A Legendary Lunch at Dolmama</h3>
    <p><strong>What I ordered:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Khorovats – Armenian grilled BBQ</li>
        <li>Dolma – grape leaves with spiced meat</li>
        <li>Lobio – hearty bean stew</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The atmosphere? Music in the background, full tables, and red wine that made time slow down.</p>

    <h3>🍸 Nightlife Like You Won't Believe</h3>

    <h3>🎄 Christmas in Yerevan</h3>
    <p>Snow fell that night. Republic Square turned white. Hot wine, laughter, lovers, and the sound of joy filled the air. I didn’t feel like a tourist. I felt like a local.</p>
